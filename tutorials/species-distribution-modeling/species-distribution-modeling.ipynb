        "### What is Species Distribution Modeling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Species Distribution Modeling (SDM below) is the most common methodology used to estimate the actual or potential geographic distribution of a species. It involves characterizing the environmental conditions suitable for a particular species and then identifying where these suitable conditions are distributed geographically.\n",
        "\n",
        "SDM has emerged as a crucial component of conservation planning in recent years, and various modeling techniques have been developed for this purpose. Implementing SDM in Google Earth Engine (GEE below) provides easy access to large-scale environmental data, along with powerful computing capabilities and support for machine learning algorithms, allowing for rapid modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Note: Conservation biologist Dr. Ramiro D. Crego implemented SDM using the GEE JavaScript Code Editor and published his research findings [(Crego et al, 2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.13491). The methodology of SDM introduced here has been translated and modified from the [JavaScript source code](https://smithsonian.github.io/SDMinGEE/) he shared into the Python language.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Required for SDM\n",
        "\n",
        "SDM typically utilizes the relationship between known species occurrence records and environmental variables to identify the conditions under which a population can sustain. In other words, two types of model input data are required:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Occurrence records of known species\n",
        "1. Various environmental variables\n",
        "\n",
        "These data are input into algorithms to identify environmental conditions associated with the presence of species.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Workflow of SDM using GEE\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow for SDM using GEE is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Collection and preprocessing of species occurrence data\n",
        "1. Definition of the area of interest\n",
        "1. Addition of GEE environmental variables\n",
