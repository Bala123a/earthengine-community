        "\n",
        "Species Distribution Modeling (SDM below) is the most common methodology used to estimate the actual or potential geographic distribution of a species. It involves characterizing the environmental conditions suitable for a particular species and then identifying where these suitable conditions are distributed geographically.\n",
        "\n",
        "SDM has emerged as a crucial component of conservation planning in recent years, and various modeling techniques have been developed for this purpose. Implementing SDM in Google Earth Engine provides easy access to large-scale environmental data, along with powerful computing capabilities and support for machine learning algorithms, allowing for rapid modeling.\n",

If you plan to have more than one tutorial out for review at a time, you will need to create a separate branch for each pull request ([instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)).\n",
